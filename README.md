# PresiVault

> **A decentralized, privacy-first personal data vault.**

PresiVault is an open initiative to give individuals and organizations full control over their personal data.  
It provides a secure, interoperable, and compliant foundation for storing, sharing, and tracking personal information — without compromising privacy.

## 🔒 Vision

In today's digital landscape, personal data is scattered across countless platforms, often without transparency or control.  
**PresiVault** aims to become the trusted, privacy-by-design layer between people, apps, and organizations.

We believe users should decide:
- **Where** their data is stored  
- **Who** can access it  
- **When** it should be revoked or deleted  

PresiVault helps applications stay compliant with **GDPR** and **data minimization principles**, while giving end users sovereignty over their information.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

PresiVault will consist of several interoperable components:

| Module | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Core Vault** | Encryption, key management, traceability and access control |
| **SDK / API** | Integration for third-party apps to delegate personal data management |
| **Web Interface** | Secure personal vault for individuals and organizations |
| **OSS Layer** | On-premise and self-hosted version (AGPLv3) |
| **Compliance Engine** | Auditing, consent tracking, and automatic data revocation |

Each component can be deployed independently or integrated into existing ecosystems.

## 🌍 Open Source Commitment

PresiVault will be released under the **AGPLv3 license**, ensuring that improvements and hosted versions remain open and transparent.  
This model prevents proprietary forks that would exploit the open-source community while allowing public and private organizations to build upon it responsibly.

> The OSS version will remain **100% free and auditable**, while commercial editions may include additional managed services and integrations.
